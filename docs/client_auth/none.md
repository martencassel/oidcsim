Alright — let’s break down the **conceptual model** of **No Authentication** for **public clients** in OAuth 2.0 / OIDC.

## 🧩 What is a “public client”?
In OAuth terms, a **public client** is an application that **cannot keep a secret safe** because its code or storage is accessible to the end user. Examples:
- **Single Page Applications (SPAs)** running in the browser
- **Native mobile apps** (iOS, Android)
- **Desktop apps** distributed to users

If you gave these apps a `client_secret`, it would be exposed — anyone could extract it from the code or memory.

## 🚫 No client authentication
Because a public client can’t securely store a secret, the **authorization server does not require client authentication** at the token endpoint.
- The client still has a **`client_id`** (public identifier)
- But it **does not send a `client_secret`** or sign a JWT for authentication
- The server treats the client as **unauthenticated** and relies on other mechanisms to protect the flow

## ⚙️ Conceptual flow without client authentication
Here’s how it works in, say, the **Authorization Code Flow with PKCE** (the modern best practice for public clients):

1. **App registration**
   - You register the app with the IdP and get a `client_id`
   - No `client_secret` is issued

2. **User authorization**
   - The public client redirects the user to the authorization server’s login page
   - It includes a **PKCE code challenge** to bind the request to the client instance

3. **Authorization server issues code**
   - After the user logs in and consents, the server sends an **authorization code** back to the client

4. **Token request (no authentication)**
   - The client sends the authorization code, `client_id`, and **PKCE code verifier** to the token endpoint
   - No `client_secret` is included

5. **Server verification**
   - The server checks the PKCE code verifier against the original challenge
   - If valid, it issues tokens (access token, ID token, refresh token if allowed)

## 🔐 How security is maintained without a secret
Even though the client isn’t authenticated, the flow is still secure because:
- **PKCE** (Proof Key for Code Exchange) prevents code interception attacks
- **Redirect URI validation** ensures the code is only sent to registered endpoints
- **Short-lived tokens** limit the impact if stolen
- **Refresh token rotation** (if used) reduces replay risk

---

## 📦 Conceptual analogy
Think of a public client like a **guest pass** to a building:
- The pass has your name (`client_id`) printed on it, but no PIN code (`client_secret`)
- Security doesn’t rely on the pass being uncopyable — instead, they check your face (user authentication) and watch where you go (PKCE + redirect URI)

If you want, I can **diagram the difference** between a confidential client (with a secret) and a public client (no authentication) so you can see exactly where the authentication step disappears and what replaces it. That visual makes the model click instantly. Would you like me to prepare that?
