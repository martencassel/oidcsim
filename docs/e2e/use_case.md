If your goal is to **deliver something tangible end‑to‑end** in your IdP/Authorization Server, you want a use case that:

- Touches **all layers** (interface → application → domain → infrastructure)
- Exercises **core identity concepts** (authentication, policy, session)
- Is **small enough** to implement in a first iteration, but **foundational** so you can build on it

For an IdP, the perfect candidate is usually:

---

## **Use Case: “Browser‑based login for Authorization Code flow”**

**Why this one?**
- It’s the front door for most OAuth2/OIDC clients.
- It forces you to wire together authentication, session management, and OAuth2 protocol handling.
- It’s visible to end users (UI) and integrators (protocol compliance).
- Once it works, you can layer on MFA, step‑up, consent, token issuance, etc.

---

### **Scope for the first E2E slice**
1. **Interface Layer**
   - `/authorize` endpoint (OAuth2 handler) that:
     - Parses request params (`client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `scope`, `state`)
     - Checks for an authenticated session
     - Redirects to `/login` if not authenticated
   - `/login` GET → renders username/password form
   - `/login` POST → submits credentials

2. **Application Layer**
   - `AuthenticationService`:
     - `Initiate()` → returns flow spec (just password for now)
     - `Complete()` → verifies credentials, applies policy, stores `AuthResult` in session
   - `GrantFlowService`:
     - After login, issues authorization code and redirects back to client

3. **Domain Layer**
   - `AuthRequest`, `AuthResult`, `Authenticator` interface
   - `PasswordAuthenticator` contract
   - `Policy` interface (basic: “must be authenticated”)

4. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - `PasswordAuthenticator` implementation using a local `IdentityProvider` (e.g., SQL + bcrypt)
   - `SessionStore` (in‑memory or Redis)
   - `ClientRepository` (static config for now)

---

### **End‑to‑end flow**
```
Browser → GET /authorize?client_id=abc&scope=openid
    ↓
OAuth2 handler: no session → redirect to /login
    ↓
GET /login → render password form
    ↓
POST /login → AuthenticationService.Complete()
    ↓
SessionStore: save AuthResult
    ↓
Redirect back to /authorize
    ↓
OAuth2 handler: session OK → issue code → redirect to client
```

---

### **Deliverables in this slice**
- **Working login UI** (HTML form)
- **Session cookie** with secure attributes
- **Password verification** against a user store
- **Authorization Code issuance** (no refresh tokens yet)
- **Redirect back to client with `code` and `state`**
- **Basic error handling** (invalid client, bad credentials)

---

### **Why start here**
- It’s the **minimum viable IdP**: a client can integrate and get an authorization code.
- You’ll have exercised:
  - HTTP routing
  - Session management
  - Authentication flow orchestration
  - Domain contracts and infrastructure adapters
  - OAuth2 protocol compliance for one grant type
- It’s easy to extend:
  - Add MFA as a second step in the flow
  - Add consent screen after login
  - Add token endpoint to exchange code for tokens
  - Add OIDC claims in ID token

If you want, I can map this **exact use case** into a **checklist of tasks per layer** so you can tick them off and know when you’ve got a working E2E slice. That way you can deliver a demoable feature quickly and build momentum. Would you like me to prepare that checklist for you?
